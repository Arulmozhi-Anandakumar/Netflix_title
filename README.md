**🧹 Netflix Titles Data Cleaning (Beginner Project)**

This project focuses on data cleaning and preprocessing of the netflix_titles.csv dataset using Python (Pandas) in Google Colab.
It is a beginner-friendly project designed to understand how to explore, clean, and prepare raw data for further analysis or machine learning.

**📊 Dataset**

Name: netflix_titles.csv

Source: Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset

Description: Contains details about Netflix shows and movies, including title, type, director, cast, country, release year, and more.

**🚀 Steps Performed**

Load the dataset – Read CSV into a pandas DataFrame

Explore data – Check shape, columns, and sample rows

Handle missing values – Fill with Unknown or clean them

Remove duplicates – Ensure unique records

Clean text data – Remove special characters and extra spaces

Convert dates – Transform date_added into datetime format

Save cleaned dataset – Export as cleaned_netflix_titles.csv

**🧰 Tools & Libraries Used**
